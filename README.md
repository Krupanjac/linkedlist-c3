# Generic Linked List in c3 Programming Language

This is a simple implementation of a generic linked list module written in C3 programming language. It is intended for testing and demonstration purposes of the C3 language features.

Project Structure:
- `linkedlist.c3`: The main source file containing the linked list implementation.
- `main.c3`: A sample file to demonstrate the usage of the linked list module.
- 
Getting Started:
To use the linked list module, simply import the `linkedlist.c3` file in your C3 project. You can create a linked list, add elements, remove elements, and traverse the list using the provided functions.
How to compile:
```
c3c compile-run ./main.c3 ./linkedlist.c3
```
This command compiles and runs the `main.c3` file along with the `linkedlist.c3` module.
